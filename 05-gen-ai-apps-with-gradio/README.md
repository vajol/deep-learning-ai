This lesson aims to equip learners with the knowledge to build an interactive image captioning application, leveraging Gradio for ease of use and accessibility. It prepares them for the next course topic, which will delve into generating new images, further expanding their skills in developing generative AI applications.

## 3. Image generation app

This lesson guides participants through the development of an image generation application utilizing an open-source text-to-image model named Stable Diffusion. The model, accessible via an API, is adept at converting textual descriptions into corresponding images. This reverse process from previous lessons (where an image to text conversion was discussed) underscores the model's versatility in learning from image-caption pairs to achieve its objective.

Key points covered in the lesson include:

- Introduction to Stable Diffusion, a diffusion model for generating images from text descriptions.

- Explanation of the API setup and the creation of a Gradio application interface to interact with the model, showcasing its ability to produce images based on varied prompts.

- Detailed walkthrough on configuring the UI with advanced options for image generation, such as negative prompts, inference steps, guidance scale, and image dimensions, to refine output quality.

- Exploration of Gradio Accordion for organizing advanced options in a collapsible format, making the UI cleaner and more user-friendly.

Participants are encouraged to experiment with the Gradio app's functionality, adjusting prompts and parameters to explore the model's creative potential. The lesson concludes with a teaser for the next session, promising to combine image-to-text and text-to-image models into a singular application, hinting at an engaging game development exercise. This progression illustrates the course's hands-on approach to teaching generative AI application development, emphasizing interactive learning and creative exploration.

## 4. Describe-and-Generate game

In this lesson, the focus shifts towards synthesizing previously acquired skills in text-to-image and image-to-text applications to create an engaging, interactive game using Gradio. This game uniquely combines the functionalities of captioning images and generating images from text descriptions, thereby encapsulating the essence of both processes into a single, fun application.

Key elements of the lesson include:

- Recap of the skills learned in previous lessons, including building Gradio apps for NLP applications, image captioning, and text-to-image generation.

- Introduction to the game concept, where an image is captioned and then used as a basis to generate a new image, forming a creative loop that mimics the telephone game.

- Detailed guidance on setting up the necessary functions and Gradio blocks to facilitate the game, including functions for converting images to and from Base64, captioning images, and generating images from text.
